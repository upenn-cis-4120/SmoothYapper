            The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
            For example: If one side is 3 units and the other side is 4 units, the hypotenuse will be 5 units because $begin:math:text$3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$end:math:text$.
            Do you need help solving a specific problem with this theorem?
